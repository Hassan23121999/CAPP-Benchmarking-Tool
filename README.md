# CAPP-Benchmarking-Tool
A comprehensive tool for evaluating Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems based on accuracy, speed, and interoperability, providing a holistic benchmark score

# Benchmarking Tool

## Project Description
This repository contains a comprehensive tool for evaluating Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems. The tool assesses systems based on three primary criteria: accuracy, speed, and interoperability, providing an overall benchmark score. It includes a user-friendly interface with multiple tabs for different test functionalities and a leaderboard to compare CAPP systems.

## Features
- **Accuracy Testing:** Assess the precision of your CAPP system by comparing predicted process plans with predefined test cases.
- **Speed Testing:** Measure the time taken by your CAPP system to process a specific test case.
- **Interoperability Testing:** Evaluate the range of formats supported by your CAPP system.
- **Leaderboard:** View and compare overall scores of different CAPP systems tested.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- json

### Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hassan23121999/Benchmarking-Tool.git
cd Benchmarking-Tool
```

## Usage
### Launching the Application
To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
python Benchmarking_Tool.py
```

### Navigating the Application
1. **Accuracy Tab:**
   - Conduct the accuracy test by reviewing and comparing your CAPP system's predicted process plans with the provided test cases.
   - Submit your answers to calculate the accuracy score.

2. **Speed Tab:**
   - Prepare for the speed test by locating the "Test Case 1" file.
   - Start and stop the timer to measure the processing speed and calculate the speed score.

3. **Interoperability Tab:**
   - Select the interoperable formats supported by your CAPP system.
   - Submit your selection to record the interoperability score.

4. **Leaderboard Tab:**
   - View the leaderboard ranking of all tested CAPP systems based on their overall scores.
   - Reset the leaderboard if needed.

### Saving and Resetting Data
- Your scores and leaderboard data are automatically saved upon completion of each test.
- Reset the leaderboard data by clicking the "Reset Leaderboard" button in the Leaderboard tab.

### Closing the Application
To exit the application, close the main window or press \`Alt+F4\`.
